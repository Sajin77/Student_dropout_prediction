# Student Dropout Prediction – Early Risk Detection with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict student dropout risk at the time of enrolment using machine learning. The goal is to enable universities to proactively support students who may be at risk, by analysing early indicators such as demographics, academic performance, financial status, and behavioural patterns.

---

## Objective

- Classify students as likely to **drop out**, **stay enrolled**, or **succeed**.
- Use data-driven insights to enable **timely interventions** through counselling, academic support, or financial aid.
- Help institutions improve **student retention**, **performance**, and **SDG 4: Quality Education**.

---

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**: Dropped non-informative columns and handled missing values.
- **Feature Selection**: Used SHAP values and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- **Model Training**: Applied Random Forest, tuned parameters, and achieved high recall.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy: 93.95%
  - Recall (Dropouts): 92.23%
  - AUC: 0.97 (strong discrimination)
- **Interpretation**: Visualised confusion matrix, true/false positives, and explained model insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualisation
- Random Forest Classifier
- Feature engineering & cross-validation

---

## Project Highlights

- Flagged early risks before academic decline began.
- Integrated features from academic records, mental health surveys, and financial data.
- Proposed a real-time alert system for student support teams.

---


## Learnings & Reflections

- Gained experience in **data preprocessing**, **classification modelling**, and **educational analytics**.
- Understood the ethical challenges (bias, fairness) in using predictive models in education.
- Saw the importance of interpretability and stakeholder engagement.
